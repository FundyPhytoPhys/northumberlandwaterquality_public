  abstract = {Rainfall effects on beach water quality in southern California are large enough that county health departments typically issue warnings for the public to avoid recreational water contact for 3 days following a storm. To enhance the scientific foundation for these preemptive public health warnings, we examined the relationship between rainfall and beach indicator bacteria concentrations using 5 years of fecal coliform data taken daily at 20 sites in southern California. There was a countrywide increase in ocean bacterial concentrations associated with almost all storms larger than 6\,mm and with every storm larger than 25\,mm. Only for storms less than 2.5\,mm was there no observable rainfall effect. Bacterial concentrations remained elevated for 5 days following a storm, although they generally returned to levels below state water quality standards within 3 days. The length of the antecedent dry period had a minimal effect on this relationship, probably reflecting a quickly developed equilibrium between the decay of older fecal material and the introduction of new fecal material to the landscape.},

  abstract = {Microbial pollution at ocean beaches is a global public health problem that can be exacerbated by excessive rainfall, particularly at beaches adjacent to urban areas. Rain is acknowledged as a predictive factor of Enterococcus levels at NJ beaches, but to date no study has explicitly examined the link. Here, five beaches (156 observations) in Monmouth County, NJ, with storm drain outflows present were sampled for Enterococcus and water quality during dry and wet periods. Hypotheses included (1) beaches differ in Enterococcus levels, (2) Enterococcus is present year-round, and (3) Enterococcus exceedances could be modeled based on environmental parameters. Beaches showed significantly different median Enterococcus levels, with site SEA2 (Neptune Blvd. in Deal, NJ) lower than others and site SEA4 (South Bath Ave. in Long Branch, NJ) higher than the other sites. Elevated Enterococcus levels were detected at water temperatures from 6.5 to 22.2~{$^\circ$}C. Multiple linear regression models identified rainfall (+), water temperature (+), and water level (-) as related to Enterococcus concentrations levels at these beaches. For the purpose of simulating the efficacy of different monitoring strategies, a hindcast model of Enterococcus abundance based on historic rainfall, water temperature, and water level data was produced. Results indicated that once-per-week sampling detected\,{\textasciitilde}14\% (e.g., 1/7) exceedance events, while sampling during summer alone detected\,{\textasciitilde}\,50\% of annual exceedance events. Models of Enterococcus exceedance based on readily available environmental time series have the potential to supplement and improve Enterococcus monitoring at NJ beaches.},

In this study, samples collected from landfills, treated wastewater  storage lagoons, and public beaches demonstrated a spatial and temporal overlap  of markers for gull and human-associated microorganisms. In addition, markers for  gull, fecal indicator bacteria, and the human-associated marker, HF183, were  detected in gull feces and cloacae samples. Further, HF183 was detected in  cloacae samples from gulls that were documented by radio-telemetry traveling  between human waste sites and public beaches.

  abstract = {Microbiological quality of shellfish production areas along the French coast is assessed through quantification of fecal coliforms, commonly used as indicators of fecal pollution. Their concentration is measured in filter-feeding molluscs, presumed to integrate highly fluctuating quantities of these germs from the surrounding filtrated water. In the context of a bacteriological monitoring network, knowledge of contamination spatial structures may help for further optimal sampling designs. This study aims at applying geostatistical techniques to describe and characterize the spatial structure of the fecal contamination in mussels (Mytilus edulis) over a given production area (Havre de la Vanl{\'e}e, France), located in macrotidal waters. In comparison with common interpolation methods, the kriging estimator, a basic tool in geostatistics, presents the major advantage of providing unbiased estimates with known and minimum variances. It thus appears to be the most powerful procedure to produce contour maps for the concentration estimates and their standard deviations. Differences in mean concentration between the two conducted surveys are compared with differences in concentration found in continental inputs. Although two surveys are not sufficient to assess accurately spatio-temporal variabilities, the use of kriging reveals high spatial heterogeneity, with different structures and meteorological conditions from one survey to the other. This leads to questioning the validity of a monitoring based on a few sampling stations over a large area sampled monthly to estimate a mean bacteriological level.},

  abstract = {Marine beach water quality is typically monitored in early morning once a week without respect to tidal condition. To assess the effect of tide on this public health warning system, we analyzed enterococci (ENT) data from 60 southern California marine beaches with differing geomorphology, orientation, and proximity to runoff sources. ENT concentrations during spring tides were significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.1) than those during neap tides at 50 of the beaches, and at the majority of these, water samples were also more than twice as likely to be out of compliance with the ENT single-sample standard during spring tides compared to neap tides. When tide range (spring/neap) and tide stage (ebb/flood) conditions were considered together, spring-ebb tides yielded the highest ENT concentrations and the greatest chance of exceeding the single-sample standard at the majority of beaches. The proximity to a terrestrial runoff source, the slope of the runoff source, the slope of the beach, and the orientation of the beach had minimal influence on the tidal modulation of ENT concentrations. The presence of spring and spring-ebb tide signals at such a great percentage of beaches suggests that tide should be considered in the design and interpretation of beach monitoring program data. It also suggests that ENT delivered by tidally forced sources other than terrestrial surficial runoff are widespread. Possibilities include ENT-laden groundwater (saline and fresh) from the beach aquifer as well as ENT-enriched sands, decaying wrack, and bird feces near the high water line.},

Because they are shed in human and animal feces, are readily culturable, and predict human health risks from exposure to polluted recreational waters, they are used as surrogates for waterborne pathogens and as fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in research and in water quality testing throughout the world. Evidence from several decades of research demonstrates, however, that enterococci may be present in high densities in the absence of obvious fecal sources and that environmental reservoirs of these FIB are important sources and sinks, with the potential to impact water quality. This review focuses on the distribution and microbial ecology of enterococci in environmental (secondary) habitats, including the effect of environmental stressors; an outline of their known and apparent sources, sinks, and fluxes; and an overview of the use of enterococci as FIB. Finally, the significance of emerging methodologies, such as microbial source tracking (MST) and empirical predictive models, as tools in water quality monitoring is addressed. The mounting evidence for widespread extraenteric sources and reservoirs of enterococci demonstrates the versatility of the genus Enterococcus and argues for the necessity of a better understanding of their ecology in natural environments, as well as their roles as opportunistic pathogens and indicators of human pathogens.},

The plan presented here is preliminary since some options presented will need further evaluation (costing and environmental impact assessment) before they can be adopted as viable solutions. This work will be ongoing in 2007. Also, since not all community members have participated in the process, a broader community consultation will need to be engaged to ensure the proposed plan represents the views of residents and users of Pointe-du-Chene.

This study aimed to assess the  combination of environmental factors that best predicts Escherichia coli (E.  coli) concentration at public beaches in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, by  combining the region's microbial water quality data and publicly available  environmental data from 2013 to 2021. We developed a Bayesian log-normal  mixed-effects regression model to evaluate predictors of geometric E. coli  concentrations at 15 beaches in the Metro Vancouver Region. We identified that  higher levels of geometric mean E. coli levels were predicted by higher previous  sample day E. coli concentrations, higher rainfall in the preceding 48~h, and  higher 24-h average air temperature at the median or higher levels of the 24-h  mean ultraviolet (UV) index. In contrast, higher levels of mean salinity were  predicted to result in lower levels of E. coli. Finally, we determined that the  average effects of the predictors varied highly by beach. Our findings could form  the basis for building real-time predictive marine water quality models to enable  more timely beach management decision-making.},

  abstract = {Current methods for the analyses of enterococcal densities include the membrane filtration (MF) technique and the multiple tube fermentation technique for the most probable number (MPN). Both techniques are labour intensive, tedious, and require a minimum of 48--72 h before results can be obtained. The Enterolert{\textregistered} system, designed to detect enterococci in water in 24 h, uses 4-methylumbelliferyl-{\ss}-D-glucoside as a defined substrate nutrient indicator. This compound, when hydrolysed by enterococcal-{\ss}-glucosidase, releases 4-methylumbelliferone which exhibits fluorescence under a UV365 lamp. In this study 343 marine water samples from selected sites in the Wellington area of New Zealand were tested to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of Enterolert in parallel with the MF method. Statistical analysis of parallel test results showed a strong linear correlation (r = 0.927) and no significant difference between the two methods by paired Mest analysis (P = 0.39). Based on the 2.4\% false positive and 0.3\% false negative rates, Enterolert was found to have a sensitivity of 99.8\% and a specificity of 97.0\%. Activity-costing analyses revealed that the variable cost per test was less for Enterolert (NZ\$18.33) than MF (NZ\$22.79). Significant time savings are achieved because Enterolert requires less time than MF for reagent preparation, sample set-up, incubation, and reading of tests. The results from this study suggest that more widespread use of this new technology in marine water quality monitoring is warranted, since rapid tests mean that monitoring agencies can respond to sudden increases in enterococci numbers more quickly and can therefore take immediate corrective action to ensure the safety of users of recreational waters.},

  abstract = {The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act (BEACH Act) requires states to develop monitoring and notification programs for recreational waters using approved bacterial indicators. Implementation of an appropriate monitoring program can, under some circumstances, be expensive. This study explored the use of composite sampling at two Racine, Wisconsin beaches over a four month period (n = 68 days) to determine whether compositing can provide a valid, unbiased, and cost-effective measure of water quality. Multiple point sampling occurred throughout the bathing season, with water samples collected daily from three or four fixed locations along each beach. From each individual sample, well-mixed aliquots were combined to form a composite sample. Individual and composite samples were assayed identically for Escherichia coli using Colilert-18 and Quanti-Tray 2000 (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME). Results from this study indicate a reasonable expectation of a simple 1:1 ratio between the composite samples and the arithmetic mean of the individual samples. Additionally, log variance of the composite sample results did not differ significantly from that of the single sample averages (p \&gt; 0.2). Empirical values for log standard deviations varied by no more than 7\% between the composite sample and individually assayed samples. Thus compositing, as performed in this study, appears to introduce neither significant bias nor additional variability into the monitoring results and stands as a reasonable alternative to data sets derived from single-sample methods. Regulatory programs adopting this approach could maintain sample integrity while reducing costs associated with recreational water quality assessment.},

Due to limited information available concerning human shedding of these microbes, this study focused on estimating the amounts of enterococci and S. aureus shed by bathers directly off their skin and indirectly via sand adhered to skin. Two sets of experiments were conducted at a marine beach located in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The first study, referred to as the ``large pool'' study, involved 10 volunteers who immersed their bodies in 4700L during four 15min cycles with exposure to beach sand in cycles 3 and 4. The ``small pool'' study involved 10 volunteers who were exposed to beach sand for 30min before they individually entered a small tub. After each individual was rinsed with off-shore marine water, sand and rinse water were collected and analyzed for enterococci. Results from the ``large pool'' study showed that bathers shed concentrations of enterococci and S. aureus on the order of 6{\texttimes}105 and 6{\texttimes}106 colony forming units (CFU) per person in the first 15min exposure period, respectively. Significant reductions in the bacteria shed per bather (50\% reductions for S. aureus and 40\% for enterococci) were observed in the subsequent bathing cycles. The ``small pool'' study results indicated that the enterococci contribution from sand adhered to skin was small (about 2\% of the total) in comparison with the amount shed directly from the bodies of the volunteers. Results indicated that bathers transport significant amounts of enterococci and S. aureus to the water column, and thus human microbial bathing load should be considered as a non-point source when designing recreational water quality models.},

Methods and results: Faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. High levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. Low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. Bacterial isolates presumptively identified as Enterococcus on mEI media were speciated. The predominant species found in both water and sediment included Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii. A number of isolates (11-26\%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mEI media were subsequently identified as species other than Enterococcus. At both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. Conclusions: High levels of Enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. Significance and impact of the study: Resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.}

This study examined the effects of a year-round dog exercise area in the Burke Creek Recreational Area (BCRA) in the arid alpine environment of Stateline, Nevada. Burke Creek drains a small, high relief watershed, flows through a sedimentation basin in the BCRA, and enters Lake Tahoe. Over the course of 14 months, we analyzed water samples from the creek for Escherichia coli and collected feces from plots to estimate fecal accumulation. We found that accumulation was highly localized within the study area, amounting to approximately 100.1 lbs (45.5 kg) of dry matter in 14 months. Statistical analysis indicated, however, that fecal bacteria in water decreased as the stream flowed through the area, presumably due to effects of the sedimentation basin, wetlands, and die-off of E. coli in feces from exposure to environmental stresses. These results are useful for managing heavily used sites and understanding the effects of this type of land use on water quality.]}

  abstract = {Most probable number (MPN) and colony-forming-unit (CFU) estimates of fecal coliform bacteria concentration are common measures of water quality in coastal shellfish harvesting and recreational waters. Estimating procedures for MPN and CFU have intrinsic variability and are subject to additional uncertainty arising from minor variations in experimental protocol. It has been observed empirically that the standard multiple-tube fermentation (MTF) decimal dilution analysis MPN procedure is more variable than the membrane filtration CFU procedure, and that MTF-derived MPN estimates are somewhat higher on average than CFU estimates, on split samples from the same water bodies. We construct a probabilistic model that provides a clear theoretical explanation for the variability in, and discrepancy between, MPN and CFU measurements. We then compare our model to water quality samples analyzed using both MPN and CFU procedures, and find that the (often large) observed differences between MPN and CFU values for the same water body are well within the ranges predicted by our probabilistic model. Our results indicate that MPN and CFU intra-sample variability does not stem from human error or laboratory procedure variability, but is instead a simple consequence of the probabilistic basis for calculating the MPN. These results demonstrate how probabilistic models can be used to compare samples from different analytical procedures, and to determine whether transitions from one procedure to another are likely to cause a change in quality-based management decisions.},

GIS techniques were used to identify and calculate land use and spatial variables to be used in a regression model. The regression analysis was performed to identify specific land-use characteristics that may influence fecal coliform densities in the estuary. The regression modeling used land-use parameters to explain the variability of fecal coliform densities measured monthly at 21 locations in the estuary over the 10-year period from 1989 to 1998. Individual regression models were generated for each season, and for a combined data set. The results of the regression analyses indicate that proximity to areas with septic tanks, and rainfall runoff from urbanized areas are important predictors of fecal coliform densities in the estuary. Sampling sites closer to areas with high densities of active septic tanks or more urbanized land uses tended to have higher fecal coliform densities. Although these results may suggest that septic tanks are a substantial human source of fecal pollution, previous research has indicated that the fecal pollution in those areas is probably not from human sources. The areas of Murrells Inlet with higher septic tank densities also are located in areas of high housing density, are in close proximity to the land--water interface, and are in the extreme upper reaches of the estuary, where flushing and dilution effects may be reduced. The higher fecal coliform densities observed at these locations may be a coincidental result of these factors and fecal deposition from pets, and not the direct result of fecal pollution input from the septic tanks. The results also show seasonal differences in the dynamics of fecal coliform bacterial pollution in the estuary. The winter model included a rainfall interaction term, which indicates that ground saturation effects may be an important part of fecal deposition in winter months. The water quality management implications of this research include identification of strategies to reduce or intercept urban stormwater runoff, reduction of waste dumping from boats, and reduction of pet waste.},

Observations have demonstrated increasing trends in extreme precipitation in North America, and models and theory consistently suggest continued increases with future warming. Here, we address the question of whether observed changes in annual maximum 1- and 5-d precipitation can be attributed to human influence on the climate. Although attribution has been demonstrated for global and hemispheric scales, there are few results for continental and subcontinental scales. We utilize three large ensembles, including simulations from both a fully coupled Earth system model and a regional climate model. We use two different attribution approaches and find many qualitatively consistent results across different methods, different models, and different regional scales. We conclude that external forcing, dominated by human influence, has contributed to the increase in frequency and intensity of regional precipitation extremes in North America. If human emissions continue to increase, North America will see further increases in these extremes.},

  abstract = {Recreational bathing is an activity practiced by thousands of Canadians every year. While its health benefits are numerous, bathing in polluted water can also be a source of health problems. These problems are generally nonspecific and are difficult to detect through usual health monitoring systems. Most involve ear and eye ailments, febrile respiratory illness and, particularly, gastroenteritis. In 1992, Health Canada recommended microbiological guideline values for recreational water quality. The values are based on the presence of fecal indicator bacteria, namely, enterococci for marine water, and Escherichia coli or fecal coliforms for fresh water. In marine water, the guideline value is set at 35 enterococci/100 mL, while in fresh water, the standard is 200 E coli/100 mL or 200 fecal coliforms/100 mL when experience demonstrates that over 90\% of the fecal coliforms are E coli. Notwithstanding certain variances, many Canadian provinces apply these guidelines. However, in Ontario, the guideline is 100 E coli/100 mL. Over the past several years, many epidemiological studies, including randomized clinical trials, have examined the relationship between bathing in polluted water and ensuing health problems. On review of this literature, the Canadian guideline values for marine water seems appropriate, but scientific evidence argues toward lowering the Canadian guideline values for fresh water to 100 E coli/100 mL, in line with the standard currently in effect in Ontario.},

Essentially quantitative recovery was obtained  with seawater-stressed cells of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium. Neither S.  bovis, S. equinus, S. mitis, nor S. salivarius grew on the medium. The  selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background  organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was  incubated at 35 C. About 90\% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci  confirmed as such and about 12\% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact,  identified as enterococci. Plate to plate variability across samples approximated  that expected by chance alone. Verified recoveries of enterococci from natural  samples by the mE procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the KF method by  one order of magnitude.},

Levels of all indicators ranged between {$<$} 5 and {$>$} 4000  CFU/100 ml. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected infrequently (6.8\% and 2.3\%  of samples tested positive, respectively). Conversely, infectious enteroviruses  were detected at low levels in 5 of the 6 watersheds sampled. Using cluster  analysis, sites were grouped into two categories, high and low risks, based on  combined levels of indicators. These results suggest that stations of highest  pollution risk were located within areas of high OSDS densities. Furthermore,  data indicate a subsurface transport of contaminated water to surface waters. The  high prevalence of enteroviruses throughout the study area suggests a chronic  pollution problem and potential risk to recreational swimmers in and around  Sarasota Bay.},

  abstract = {Fecal contamination of water bodies causes a public health problem and economic loss. To control such contamination management actions need to be guided by sound science. From 2007--2009 a study was undertaken to determine the sources of fecal bacteria contamination to the marine waters adjoining the Town of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, USA. The research effort included sampling for fecal coliform and Enterococcus bacteria, sampling for optical brighteners, dye studies, and use of molecular bacterial source tracking techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of the Bacteroides--Prevotella group. Of the 96 samples collected from nine locations during the study, the water contact standard for Enterococcus was exceeded on 13 occasions. The T-RFLP fingerprint analyses demonstrated that the most widespread source of fecal contamination was human, occurring in 38\% of the samples, with secondary ruminant and avian sources also detected. Optical brightener concentrations were low, reflecting a lack of sewage line leakage or spills. A lack of sewer leaks and lack of septic systems in the town pointed toward discharge from boat heads into the marine waters as the major cause of fecal contamination; this was supported by dye studies. Based on these data, the Town initiated action to have the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declare the coastal waters (out to 3 nautical miles), the nearby Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and its tributaries a no-discharge zone (NDZ) to alleviate the human fecal pollution. The Town garnered supporting resolutions from other local communities who jointly petitioned the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources. This State regulatory agency supported the local government resolutions and sent an application for an NDZ to the EPA in April 2009. The EPA concurred, and in February 2010 the coastal waters of New Hanover County, NC, became the first marine area on the U.S. eastern seaboard between Delaware and the Florida Keys to be declared a no-discharge zone.},

  abstract = {Coastal areas in the United States and many other countries are considered to be desirable regions to live and recreate. However, as human use of coastal land and water increases, so does the incidence of aquatic-borne disease from contact with contaminated water and eating contaminated shellfish. Movement of humans into coastal areas both greatly increases the number of sources of microbial pathogens and radically alters the landscape through increased construction activity and paving of former natural areas. On a regional scale, increases in human population over a 14-year period in coastal North Carolina were strongly correlated with increases in shellfish bed closures due to high fecal coliform bacterial counts. On a watershed scale, an analysis of several tidal creeks found strong correlations between mean estuarine fecal coliform bacterial counts and watershed population, percent developed area and especially with percent impervious surface coverage. Conversion of natural landscapes to impervious surfaces (roads, drives, sidewalks, parking lots and roofs) removes the land's natural filtration capability, allows for increased concentration of pollutants at the land's surface and provides a means of rapid conveyance of pollutants to downstream waterways. An analysis of rural watersheds in the Coastal Plain found that stream fecal coliform counts and turbidity were both strongly correlated with rainfall in the previous 24 h in watersheds containing extensive industrial swine and poultry operations, as well as watersheds containing more traditional agriculture and cattle husbandry. In contrast, in watersheds rich in swamp wetlands these relationships were not significant, even in watersheds containing extensive animal production. Based on these findings, we suggest that waterborne microbial pathogen abundance can be minimized in urbanizing coastal areas through reduced use of impervious surfaces and maximal use of natural or constructed wetlands for passive stormwater runoff treatment. In animal husbandry areas, retention of natural wetlands and management practices designed to minimize sediment runoff can likely reduce inputs of pathogenic microbes into streams.},

Escherichia coli and enterococci are important indicators to assess, monitor, and predict microbial water quality in natural ecosystems. During rainfall events, the amount of wastewater delivered to rivers and coastal systems is increased dramatically. This study implements measures capable of monitoring the pathways of wastewater discharge to rivers and the transport of faecal bacteria to the coastal area during and following extreme rainfall events. Spatio-temporal variability of faecal microorganisms and their relationship with environmental variables and sewage outflow in an area located in the western Adriatic coast (Fano, Italy) was monitored. The daily monitoring during the rainy events was carried out for two summer seasons, for a total of five sampling periods. These results highlight that faecal microbial contaminations were related to rainy events with a high flow of wastewater, with recovery times for the microbiological indicators varying between 24 and 72 h and influenced by a dynamic dispersion. The positive correlation between ammonium and faecal bacteria at the Arzilla River and the consequences in seawater can provide a theoretical basis for controlling ammonium levels in rivers as a proxy to monitor the potential risk of bathing waters pathogen pollution.},

Although the PP method is a simple  technique, familiar to water bacteriologists, it is not recommended in the  international methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: For the MPN method, azide dextrose  broth and ethyl violet azide broth were employed. For the MF technique, Millipore  filters were placed onto azide maltose agar (KF agar), while for the PP method, 1  ml of a decimal water dilution was added to (Kennel Faecal) KF medium. Regression  analysis and Friedman's ANOVA were performed to determine the relationship  between faecal streptococci counts obtained with the three techniques.  Statistical analysis of the results showed that the MPN, MF and PP techniques  were equally valid with respect to faecal streptococci enumeration in polluted  waters. CONCLUSION: Since the PP method was found to be as good as the other  techniques, it may be preferred in polluted waters. It is more economical in  terms of both time and materials than the MPN count, and it is as accurate as the  MF count. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study indicates that the PP  method, although not recommended internationally, is a reliable alternative to MF  and MPN.},

The  original mE medium was modified by reducing the triphenyltetrazolium chloride  from 0.15 to 0.02 g/liter and adding 0.75 g of indoxyl beta-D-glucoside per  liter. The new MF medium, mEI medium, detected levels of enterococci in 24 h  comparable to those detected by the original mE medium in 48 h, with the same  level of statistical confidence. In addition, the use of mEI medium eliminated  the need to transfer the membrane to a substrate medium to differentiate  enterococci from other genera of the fecal streptococcal group. Colonies from mEI  medium were examined to determine the rates of false-positive and false-negative  occurrences. mEI medium had a false-positive rate of 6.0\% and a false-negative  rate of 6.5\%. Interlaboratory testing of the MF method with mEI medium  demonstrated that the relative reproducibility standard deviations among  laboratories ranged from 2.2\% for marine water to 18.9\% for freshwater. The  comparative recovery studies, specificity determinations, and multilaboratory  evaluation indicated that mEI medium has analytical performance characteristics  equivalent to those of mE medium. The simplicity of use and decreased incubation  time with mEI medium will facilitate the detection and quantification of  enterococci in fresh and marine recreational waters.},

Colilert-Marine Water (Colilert-MW;  Environetics, Branford, Conn.) is a rapid 24-h test that has recently been  developed to detect total coliforms and Escherichia coli in coastal water. We  performed a premarketing evaluation of the Colilert-MW product, testing it in  parallel with the multiple tube fermentation (MTF) method for 86 coastal water  samples in southern California. Statistical analysis was performed by using  paired t tests and linear regression. Bacterial isolates were evaluated by  biochemical and genetic analysis. The results of this study showed a strong  correlation between the traditional MTF and the Colilert-MW method for detection  of total coliforms (r = 0.95) and E. coli (r = 0.89) in ocean water samples.  Paired t-test results indicated that the Colilert-MW and MTF were equivalent in  detecting E. coli and that the Colilert-MW may be more sensitive in the detection  of total coliforms. We conclude that Colilert-MW would be a useful tool with  which to monitor coastal beach water.},

Coprostanol [5{$\beta$}] (5{$\beta$}(H)-holestan-3{$\beta$}-ol), cholestanol [5{$\alpha$}] (5{$\alpha$}(H)-colestan-3{$\beta$}-ol) and cholesterol abundantly found in human feces were used as molecular markers for sewage pollution monitoring in the coastal sediments. The [5{$\beta$}/(5{$\beta$}+5{$\alpha$})] ratio in the study area was found to range from 0.04 to 0.61 ({\=x}=0.27) and that of [5{$\beta$}/(5{$\alpha$}+cholesterol)] ranged from 0.02 to 0.73 ({\=x}=0.19). Semi-variograms of the two ratios were found to fit isotropic spherical models: for [5{$\beta$}/(5{$\beta$}+5{$\alpha$})]: c0=4{\texttimes}10-3, c=6.5{\texttimes}10-3, a=12000, Dc=-0.024 and R=0.91; for 5{$\beta$}/(5{$\alpha$}+cholesterol): c0=7.5{\texttimes}10-3, c=8.5{\texttimes}10-3, a=25000, Dc=-0.061 and R=0.67. Because of the more precise covariance model produced, the former stanol/sterol ratio was adopted as the sewage pollution marker for the kriging of contour map for sewage pollution. Three major sources of sewage pollution in the eastern waters of Hong Kong were highlighted, they were the densely populated Victoria Harbour, the sludge disposal site and the Inner Mirs Bay. A detailed dispersion pattern of sewage pollution around the sludge disposal site was studied. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of kriging in providing a holistic picture on the extent and spatial correlation of sewage pollution in coastal marine environment.},

The culture of labelled bacteria was automatically scanned by an optical fluorescence microscope. With sophisticated image processing algorithms, the amount of E. coli bacteria on the filter was counted. Finally, the user of the system received a summarized report of the detected E. coli colonies in the sample. The total culturing and analysis time for one water sample takes about 16 hours and therefore, is much faster than conventional methods.},

METHODS: Studies on uncontrolled waters, such as sea, lakes and  rivers were considered in this review through MEDLINE and WHO resources. Out of  the 37 studies identified, 22 were reviewed because they addressed associations  of interest and fulfilled the validity criteria. RESULTS: Most studies reported a  dose-related increase of health risk in swimmers with an increase in the  indicator-bacteria count in recreational waters. Relative risk (RR) values for  swimming in polluted water versus clean water were often significant (usually 1.0  {$<$} RR {$<$} 3.0). The indicator microorganisms that correlate best with health  outcomes were enterococci/faecal streptococci for both marine and freshwater, and  Escherichia coli for freshwater. In both marine and freshwater, increased risk of  gastro-intestinal symptoms was reported for water quality values ranging from  only a few indicator counts/100 ml to about 30 indicator counts/100 ml. These  values are low compared with the water qualities frequently encountered in  coastal recreational waters. Studies which showed a higher threshold for  increased risk and case-rate values in some countries may suggest immunity due to  endemicity or a lower pathogen-to-indicator ratio in the natural waters.  CONCLUSIONS: The review strongly suggests a causal dose-related relationship  between gastrointestinal symptoms and recreational water quality measured by  bacterial indicator counts.},

Sources of information Original and review articles from January 1998 to February 2012 were identified using PubMed and the search terms water-related illness, recreational water illness, and swimmer illness. Main message There is a 3\% to 8\% risk of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) after swimming. The high-risk groups for AGI are children younger than 5 years, especially if they have not been vaccinated for rotavirus, and elderly and immunocompromised patients. Children are at higher risk because they swallow more water when swimming, stay in the water longer, and play in the shallow water and sand, which are more contaminated. Participants in sports with a lot of water contact like triathlon and kite surfing are also at high risk, and even activities involving partial water contact like boating and fishing carry a 40\% to 50\% increase in risk of AGI compared with nonwater recreational activities. Stool cultures should be done when a recreational water illness is suspected, and the clinical dehydration scale is a useful clinical tool for assessing the treatment needs of affected children. Conclusion Recreational water illness is the main attributable cause of AGI during swimming season. Recognition that swimming is a substantial source of illness can help prevent recurrent and secondary cases. Rotavirus vaccine is highly recommended for children who will swim frequently.},

This study linked environmental data to E. coli geometric means collected at 18 beaches in Toronto (2008--2019) and the Niagara Region (2011--2019) to examine the environmental predictors of E. coli. We developed region-specific models using mixed effects models to examine E. coli as a continuous variable and recommended thresholds of E. coli concentration (100 CFU/100 mL and 200 CFU/100 mL). Substantial clustering of E. coli values at the beach level was observed in Toronto, while minimal clustering was seen in Niagara, suggesting an important beach-specific effect in Toronto beaches. Air temperature and turbidity (measured directly or visually observed) were positively associated with E. coli in all models in both regions. In Toronto, waterfowl counts, rainfall, stream discharge and water temperature were positively associated with E. coli levels, while solar irradiance and water level were negatively associated. In Niagara, wave height and water level had a positive association with E. coli, while rainfall was negatively associated. The differences in regional models suggest the importance of a region-specific approach to addressing beach water quality. The results can guide beach monitoring and management practices, including predictive modelling.},

  abstract = {To reduce the incidence of recreational waterborne illness, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are measured to assess water quality and inform beach management. Recently, predictive FIB models have been used to aid managers in making beach posting and closure decisions. However, those predictive models must be trained using rich historical data sets consisting of FIB and environmental data that span years, and many beaches lack such data sets. Here, we investigate whether water quality data collected during discrete short duration, high-frequency beach sampling events (e.g., samples collected at sub-hourly intervals for 24--48 h) are sufficient to train predictive models that can be used for beach management. We use data collected during six high-frequency sampling events at three California marine beaches and train a total of 126 models using common data-driven techniques. Tide, solar irradiation, water temperature, significant wave height, and offshore wind speed were found to be the most important environmental variables in the models. We validate the predictive performance of models using withheld data. Random forests are consistently the top performing model type. Overall, we find that data-driven models trained using high-frequency FIB and environmental data perform well at predicting water quality and can be used to inform public health decisions at beaches.}

  abstract = {AIMS: An assessment of microbial densities in an urbanized Florida watershed was performed during a period of changing rainfall patterns to investigate the role  of climate coupled with urbanization in declining water quality. METHODS AND  RESULTS: Concentrations of traditional and alternative faecal indicators were  assessed by standard methods over 24 months. Sources of faecal contamination were  determined by antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA) of faecal coliform (FC)  bacteria. Composite indices of indicator organisms based on a suite of microbial  measurements were used to quantify pollution impacts in the river. ARA results  found that FC from wild animal sources dominated during the drought, and the  relative frequency of FC from human sources increased after cumulative rainfall  increased to near-normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Changes observed in faecal  indicator densities and in FC sources during changing rainfall patterns strongly  suggest a role of precipitation on the sources and extent of microbial pollution  in urbanized coastal watersheds. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacterial  source tracking coupled with a composite index of microbial contamination  resulted in a more complete picture of microbial pollution within the river, as  opposed to the general practice of reliance on one indicator organism. Improved  land use decisions in urban areas are necessary to insure maintenance of coastal  environmental health under changing climate patterns and population density.},

They are a group of coccoid bacteria, naturally inhabiting the gut of warm-blooded animals and humans. Their potential as faecal pollution indicators was recognised in the 1890s, but it was 50 years before the accumulated knowledge of their taxonomy and sanitary significance, together with the development of isolation and enumeration methods, allowed their practical application in water pollution research and M92024 Received 6 May 1992 ; accepted 18 January 1993 management. There is still much disagreement over the classification of the group. Many workers now place some species in a separate genus, Enterococcus, and it is likely that this revised nomenclature will be incorporated into the next edition of Bergey's Manual. Of the enumeration methods available (plate count, MPN, and membrane filtration), the mE-EIA membrane filtration method, which recovers enterococci (a subset of faecal streptococci) is probably the most important, because it is the basis of current United States Environmental Protection Agency recommendations on bathing water standards. However, there appears to be no universally accepted "best method" for the isolation of faecal streptococci from natural waters. Biochemical and serological identification methods are commercially available, and research has begun into the use of DNA-based techniques for identifying faecal streptococcal strains and faecal sources.},

  abstract = {Despite numerous studies, uncertainty remains about how water quality indicators can best be used in the regulation of recreational water. We conducted a  systematic review of this topic with the goal of quantifying the association  between microbial indicators of recreational water quality and gastrointestinal  (GI) illness. A secondary goal was to evaluate the potential for GI illness below  current guidelines. We screened 976 potentially relevant studies and from these  identified 27 studies. From the latter, we determined summary relative risks for  GI illness in relation to water quality indicator density. Our results support  the use of enterococci in marine water at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  guideline levels. In fresh water, (Italic)Escherichia(/Italic) coli was a more  consistent predictor of GI illness than are enterococci and other bacterial  indicators. A log (base 10) unit increase in enterococci was associated with a  1.34 [95\% confidence intervals (CI), 1.00-1.75] increase in relative risk in  marine waters, and a log (base 10) unit increase in E. coli was associated with a  2.12 (95\% CI, 0.925-4.85) increase in relative risk in fresh water. Indicators of  viral contamination were strong predictors of GI illness in both fresh and marine  environments. Significant heterogeneity was noted among the studies. In our  analysis of heterogeneity, studies that used a nonswimming control group, studies  that focused on children, and studies of athletic or other recreational events  found elevated relative risks. Future studies should focus on the ability of new,  more rapid and specific microbial methods to predict health effects, and  estimating the risks of recreational water exposure among susceptible persons.},

  abstract = {Enterococci, are used nationwide as a water quality indicator of marine recreational beaches. Prior research has demonstrated that enterococci inputs to the study beach site (located in Miami, FL) are dominated by non-point sources (including humans and animals). We have estimated their respective source functions by developing a counting methodology for individuals to better understand their non-point source load impacts. The method utilizes camera images of the beach taken at regular time intervals to determine the number of people and animal visitors. The developed method translates raw image counts for week days and weekend days into daily and monthly visitation rates. Enterococci source functions were computed from the observed number of unique individuals for average days of each month of the year, and from average load contributions for humans and for animals. Results indicate that dogs represent the larger source of enterococci relative to humans and birds.},

  abstract = {Fecal bacterial contamination of nearshore waters has direct economic impacts to coastal communities through the loss of shellfisheries and restrictions of recreational uses. We conducted seasonal measurements of fecal coliform (FC) sources and transport pathways contributing to FC contamination of Buttermilk Bay, a shallow embayment adjacent to Buzzards Bay, MA. Typical of most coastal embayments, there were no direct sewage discharges (i.e., outfalls), and fecal bacteria from human, domestic animal, and wildlife pools entered open waters primarily through direct deposition or after transport through surface waters or groundwaters. Direct fecal coliform inputs to bay waters occurred primarily in winter (December-March) from waterfowl, {$\sim$}33 {\texttimes} 1012 FC yr-1 or {$\sim$}67\% of the total annual loading. Effects of waterfowl inputs on bay FC densities were mitigated by their seasonality, wide distribution across the bay surface, and the apparent limited dispersal from fecal pellets. On-site disposal of sewage by septic systems was the single largest FC source in the watershed-embayment system, 460 {\texttimes} 1012 FC yr-1, but due to attenuation during subsurface transport only a minute fraction, {$<$} 0.006 {\texttimes} 1012 FC yr-1, reached bay waters ({$<$}0.01\% of annual input to bay). Instead, surface water flows, via storm drains and natural streams under both wet- and dry-weather conditions, contributed the major terrestrial input, 12 {\texttimes} 1012 FC yr-1 (24\% of annual input), all from animal sources. Since most of the surface water FC inputs were associated with periodic, short-duration rain events with discharge concentrated in nearshore zones, wet-weather flows were found to have a disproportionately high impact on nearshore FC levels. Elution of FC from shoreline deposits of decaying vegetation (wrack) comprised an additional coliform source. Both laboratory and field experiments suggest significant elution of bacteria from wrack, {$\sim$}3 {\texttimes} 1012 FC yr-1 on a bay-wide basis (6\% of annual input), primarily by periodic tidal flooding and possibly by major rain events. Release of coliforms during resuspension of subtidal sediments was estimated to be a minor source in this system ({$<$}1.5 {\texttimes} 1012 FC yr-1 or {$<$} 3\% of annual input), primarily associated with large storm events in the fall and winter. Based upon the relative source strengths and the spatial and temporal patterns of FC input to Buttermilk Bay, it appears that management practices in similar settings should account for migratory waterfowl, but remediation efforts should focus on the redirection of stormwater runoff through the groundwater transport pathway.},

The highest  enterococci concentrations were observed in dog feces with average levels of 3.9  x 10(7) CFU/g; the next highest enterococci levels were observed in birds  averaging 3.3 x 10(5)CFU/g. The lowest measured levels of enterococci were  observed in material collected from shrimp fecal mounds (2.0 CFU/g). A comparison  of the microbial loads showed that 1 dog fecal event was equivalent to 6940 bird  fecal events or 3.2 x 10(8) shrimp fecal mounds. Comparing animal contributions  to previously published numbers for human bather shedding indicates that one  adult human swimmer contributes approximately the same microbial load as one bird  fecal event. Given the abundance of animals observed on the beach, this study  suggests that dogs are the largest contributing animal source of enterococci to  the beach site.},
